# Process scheduling algorithms

A programm which simulates basic process scheduling algorithms ([FCFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)#First_come,_first_served), [SJF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)#Priority_scheduling), [SRTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)#Shortest_remaining_time_first), [RR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)#Round-robin_scheduling)) and outputs average processes' waiting times for each of them.


Simulation runs on predefined number of series of randomly generated (but configurable to some extent) processes.
